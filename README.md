## Terraform examples

This repository contains a number of Terraform examples to be used as a complement to the official Terraform examples
available on the Terraform documentation site.

The more complex examples can be used as a base for your own environments, just clone the repo and pick what you need
and ignore the rest.

If you are completely new to Terraform I really recommend their getting started guide.

Right now the examples are focused on Amazon AWS which is the provider I have experience with. I will add examples as I
get in contact with other providers.

Have fun!

### Tools to install

You will need to install aws-cli, aws-iam-authenticator and kubectl.
